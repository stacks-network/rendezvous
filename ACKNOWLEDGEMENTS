Acknowledgements

The idea behind Rendezvous originates from several inspiring sources:

- John Hughes: For his pioneering work in property-based testing and the
  creation of QuickCheck, which laid the foundation for modern property testing.
  His paper, "Testing the Hard Stuff and Staying Sane"[^1], has been a
  significant inspiration for our approach in `rv`.
- Jude Nelson: For the valuable insights and methods presented in poxl[^2],
  demonstrating a way to write tests in Clarity.
- Nicolas Dubien: For creating fast-check[^3], the underlying property-based
  testing framework we currently use in Rendezvous.
- Jacob Stanley: For his lasting inspiration and contributions to
  property-based testing and the Hedgehog library[^4]. Jacob's legacy and
  influence remain a guiding force in our work.
- Trail of Bits: For creating Echidna[^5], which initially utilized Hedgehog,
  furthering the development of smart contract fuzzers.
- LNow: For the initial discussions and ideas on this topic in 2022.

We are deeply grateful to the Stacks Open Internet Foundation for supporting
our work and providing crucial assistance, and to the open-source community
for their continuous support and contributions.
