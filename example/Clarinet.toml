# Clarinet currently does not support type checking or dependency resolution
# for concatenated target and test contracts. To ensure successful deployment
# of the send-tokens contract (which only relies on rendezvous-token in its
# corresponding test contract), we set the epoch of rendezvous-token to 2.5.
# This ensures it precedes the epoch of the send-tokens contract (3.0).
